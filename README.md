# asconfigc

A command line utility that compiles an ActionScript project configured with an [*asconfig.json*](https://github.com/BowlerHatLLC/vscode-nextgenas/wiki/asconfig.json) file. This utility parses the configuration file and runs the compiler with the appropriate options. Supports a variety of ActionScript SDKs, including [Apache Royale](https://royale.apache.org/), the [Feathers SDK](https://feathersui.com/sdk/) and the [Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/air-sdk-download.html).

## Installation

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

```
npm install -g asconfigc
```

## Usage

Run *asconfigc* in a directory containing an [*asconfig.json*](https://github.com/BowlerHatLLC/vscode-nextgenas/wiki/asconfig.json) file.

The following options are available:

* `-p DIRECTORY` or `--project DIRECTORY`

	Compile a project in the given directory using the *asconfig.json* file. If omitted, will look for *asconfig.json* in current working directory.

* `--sdk DIRECTORY`

	Specify the directory where the ActionScript SDK is located. If omitted, defaults to checking `FLEX_HOME` and `PATH` environment variables for a supported SDK.

* `--debug=true` or `--debug=false`

	Specify debug or release mode. Overrides the `debug` compiler option, if specified in `asconfig.json`.

* `--air PLATFORM`

	Package the project as an Adobe AIR application. The allowed platforms include `android`, `ios`, `windows`, `mac`, and `air`.

* `-h` or `--help`

	Print help message.

* `-v` or `--version`

	Print the version of `asconfigc`.

## Made with Apache Royale

The source code for the `asconfigc` utility is written in ActionScript. That's right, a utility that runs on Node.js â€” written in ActionScript and compiled with [Apache Royale](https://royale.apache.org/). Pretty cool, right?
